# About ALLVP

## Investment insight
As Latin America’s middle class expands, ALLVP invests in companies that develop innovative, scalable, and cost-effective business models using new technology. We seek exceptional teams that efficiently deliver basic and value-added services to newly accessible customers.

## Where we invest
ALLVP mainly invests in Mexico, however we are seeking to support foreign companies with a regional exposure to Latin America. 

## Investment Strategy
The firm’s main investment strategy is based on co-investing in subsequent financing rounds of portfolio companies at later stages where the Fund’s capital can serve as a critical catalyst to transitioning the company into the next stage of growth.
